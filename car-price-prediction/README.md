# Car Price Prediction

This project aims to predict the prices of used cars based on features like company, kilometers driven, fuel type, and car age.

## Current Version

- The current model is built using **Linear Regression**.
- It achieves an RÂ² score of approximately **45%**, which is a good start for a first model.
- The dataset is relatively small and limited.

## Project Structure

- `car_price_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with data preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.
- `model.pkl`: Serialized machine learning model saved using pickle.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python packages required to run the notebook.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the notebook or load the saved model for predictions.

## Future Work

- Experiment with more advanced regression algorithms like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or XGBoost.
- Perform hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance.
- Use a larger and more diverse dataset.
- Add more feature engineering steps for better accuracy.
